Game Title: 21 Game

This game is a simple version of Blackjack, and focuses more on the one-on-one simple competition between the player and the dealer.  

This game plays on your browser and was created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

The player and dealer each begin a game with two cards.  The goal is to get the highest value of cards without going over the total of 21.  

Basic rules to the game:

You have a "wallet" that shows the total amount of money you have to play with.  It starts at $100 and increases or decreases based the amount you bet each hand and whether you win or lose.  Betting amounts start at $10, and you have the option to increase the amount you want to bet.  You're even allowed to keep playing and go into debt if your wallet is empty and you just can't walk away.  The wallet will keep track of your winnings and debts.  

The dealer's cards are displayed in the top row and the players are on the bottom row.  

Press the start button to begin your game.  AFter the initial two cards are dealt out, you will be given a choice to continue taking more cards ("hit"), or you can choose to "stay".  

If you hit too many times and go over 21, you will lose that round.  That is called a "bust".  

If you are satisfied with your cards, or do not want to risk "busting", then you can click the "stay" button.  The dealer will then draw his cards in an effort to get the high score.  The dealer must hit on any sum lower than 17.

One of the dealers first two cards are always hidden until you've made your decision on your hand.



Sometimes the player and dealer can have the same total value in cards.  That is called a "push".  You do not win or lose money your bet on a push.

Hitting 21 on your first two cards is called a "blackjack".

After the results of each round, the player can click the "deal" button try again.

Some options are not available after cards have been dealt.  You can not change your bet if you're in the middle of a hand and you cannot continue hitting on your hand if you've already clicked "stay".

After the majority of the deck has been dealt out, the dealer will reshuffle a full deck for you to continue playing with.


Potential Future enhancements to the game include the addition of a split option, double down option, and a max bet option.  I am also interested in adding sound effects and animations.
